For the assignment, I used the method of two dictionaries as proposed in the slides. One is the emission probability â€“ given that it is in a specified part of speech, how likely is it for a word to occur. The other marks the transitional probability of likelihood of a part of speech follows the previous part of speech. I used a constant for handling OOV words. Lastly, I created a 2D table with dictionary and then converted it into a panda dataframe to get the max for each column (the speech of the word most likely to occur). Then finally I write everything into a file.
